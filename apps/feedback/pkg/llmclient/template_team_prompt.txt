Given the following mapping of Grafana teams to their list of responsibilities:

```
{{ range $key, $value := .TeamResponsibilities }}{{ $key }}: {{ $value }}
{{ end }}
``` 

Analyze the following user feedback about Grafana and determine which teams are the best candidates to investigate it:
"{{ .UserFeedback }}"
Assess all the team candidates for the feedback and rank them based on likelihood, then give me the top three. Only reply with the team names separated by spaces.
If there is no good fit, respond back with a blank message.
