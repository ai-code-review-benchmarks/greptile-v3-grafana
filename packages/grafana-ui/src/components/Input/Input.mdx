# Input

Used for regular text input. For an array of data or tree-structured data, consider using `Select` or `Cascader` respectively.

<Canvas of={InputStories.Simple} />

## Prefix and suffix

To add more context to the input you can add either text or an icon before or after the input. You can use the `prefix` and `suffix` props for this. Try some examples in the Canvas!

## Usage in forms with Field

`Input` should be used with the `Field` component to get labels and descriptions. It can also be used for validation by using the `required` attribute. See the `Field` component for more information.

<ArgTypes of={Input} />
