<Meta title="MDX|Combobox" component={Combobox} />

## Usage

**Do**

- Use in inline query editors
- Use when you require async calls from a select input

**Don't**

- Use the async functionality, when all items are only loaded on the initial load
- Use when fewer than 4 items are needed, as a `RadioButtonGroup` may be more suitable (not for inline use cases)

## Sizing

The recommended way to set the width is by sizing the container element. This is so it may reflect a similar size as other inputs in the context.

If that is not possible, the width can be set directly on the component, by setting a number, which is a multiple of `8px`.

For inline usage, such as in query editors, it may be useful to size the input based on the content. Set `width="auto"` to achieve this. In this case, it is also recommended to set `maxWidth` and `minWidth`.

## Async Usage

The `options` prop can accept and async function:

- When the menu opens, the `options` function is called with `''`, to load all options.
- When the user types, the `options` function is called with the current input value.

Note: The calls are debounced. Old calls are invalidated when a new call is made.
