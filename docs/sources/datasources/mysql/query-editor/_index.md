# MySQL query editor

Grafanaâ€™s query editors are unique to each data source. For general information on Grafana query editors, refer to [Query editors](ref:query-editor). For general information on querying data sources in Grafana, refer to Query and transform data.

The MySQL query editor is located on the [Explore page](ref:explore). You can also access the MySQL query editor from a dashboard panel. Click the ellipsis in the upper right of the panel and select **Edit**.


<!-- This topic explains querying specific to the MySQL data source.
For general documentation on querying data sources in Grafana, see [Query and transform data](ref:query-transform-data). -->

<!-- You can run the built query by pressing the `Run query` button in the top right corner of the editor. -->

{{< figure src="/media/docs/mysql/screenshot-mysql-query-editor.v11.3.png" class="docs-image--no-shadow" >}}  

## MySQL query editor components

The MySQL query editor has two modes: **Builder** and **Code**.

Builder mode helps you build a query using a visual interface.

Code mode allows for advanced querying and offers support for complex SQL query writing. Code mode supports autocompletion of tables, columns, SQL keywords, standard sql functions, Grafana template variables and Grafana macros. Columns cannot be completed before a table has been specified.

Code mode is best for experienced MySQL users with advanced SQL querying skills. You can construct MySQL queries here without builder mode help.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If your table or database name contains a reserved word or a [prohibited character](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/identifiers.html) the editor will put quotes around the name. For example, the name `table-name` will be quoted with backticks - `` `table-name` ``.
{{% /admonition %}}

- **Format** - Select a format response from the drop-down for the MySQL query.  The default is `table`. If you use the `timeseries` format option one of the columns must be `time`. 

- **Dataset** - Select a database to query from the drop-down. 

  - **Table** - Select a table from the drop-down. Tables correspond to the chosen database. 

  - **Data operations** - _Optional_  Select an aggregation from the drop-down.

  - **Column** -  Select a column on which to run the aggregation. 

  - **Alias** - _Optional_ Add an alias from the drop-down. 

- **Filter** - Toggle to add filters. Use the first dropdown to choose whether all of the filters need to match (`AND`), or if only one of the filters needs to match (`OR`).
Use the second dropdown to choose a filter. To filter on more columns, click the plus (`+`) button to the right of the condition dropdown. o remove a filter, click the `x` button next to that filter's dropdown. After selecting a date type column, you can choose Macros from the operators list and select timeFilter which will add the $\_\_timeFilter macro to the query with the selected date column.

  - **Filter by column value** - _Optional_ If you toggle **Filter**

- **Group** - Toggle to add **Group by column**.

  - **Group by column** - Select a column to filter by from the drop-down. Click the **+sign** to filter by multiple columns. Click the **X** to remove a filter.
<!-- To group the results by column, toggle the group switch at the top of the editor. You can then choose which column to group the results by. The group by clause can be removed by pressing the X button. -->

- **Order** - Toggle to add an ORDER BY statement.

  - **Order by** - Select a column to order by from the drop-down. Select ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order. You can add an optional limit on the retrieved results. 

- **Preview** - Toggle for a preview of the SQL query generated by the query builder. Toggled on by default.


{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If a default database has been configured through the Data Source Configuration page (or through a provisioning configuration file), the user will only be able to use that single pre-configured database for querying.
{{% /admonition %}}


<!-- ### Format

The response from MySQL can be formatted as either a table or as a time series. To use the time series format one of the columns must be named `time`. -->

### Dataset and Table selection



In the dataset dropdown, choose the MySQL database to query. The dropdown is be populated with the databases that the user has access to.
When the dataset is selected, the table dropdown is populated with the tables that are available.

**Note:** If a default database has been configured through the Data Source Configuration page (or through a provisioning configuration file), the user will only be able to use that single pre-configured database for querying.

### Columns and Aggregation functions (SELECT)

Using the dropdown, select a column to include in the data. You can also specify an optional aggregation function.

Add further value columns by clicking the plus button and another column dropdown appears.

<!-- {{< docs/shared source="grafana" lookup="datasources/sql-query-builder-macros.md" version="<GRAFANA_VERSION>" >}} -->

<!-- ### Filter data (WHERE)

To add a filter, toggle the **Filter** switch at the top of the editor.
This reveals a **Filter by column value** section with two dropdown selectors.

Use the first dropdown to choose whether all of the filters need to match (`AND`), or if only one of the filters needs to match (`OR`).
Use the second dropdown to choose a filter.

To filter on more columns, click the plus (`+`) button to the right of the condition dropdown.

To remove a filter, click the `x` button next to that filter's dropdown.

After selecting a date type column, you can choose Macros from the operators list and select timeFilter which will add the $\_\_timeFilter macro to the query with the selected date column. -->

### Group By

To group the results by column, toggle the group switch at the top of the editor. You can then choose which column to group the results by. The group by clause can be removed by pressing the X button.

### Preview

By flipping the preview switch at the top of the editor, you can get a preview of the SQL query generated by the query builder.

## Code editor

{{< figure src="/static/img/docs/v92/sql_code_editor.png" class="docs-image--no-shadow" >}}

To make advanced queries, switch to the code editor by clicking `code` in the top right corner of the editor. The code editor support autocompletion of tables, columns, SQL keywords, standard sql functions, Grafana template variables and Grafana macros. Columns cannot be completed before a table has been specified.

You can expand the code editor by pressing the `chevron` pointing downwards in the lower right corner of the code editor.

`CTRL/CMD + Return` works as a keyboard shortcut to run the query.

## Macros

To simplify syntax and to allow for dynamic parts, like date range filters, the query can contain macros.

| Macro example                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$__time(dateColumn)`                                 | Will be replaced by an expression to convert to a UNIX timestamp and rename the column to `time_sec`. For example, _UNIX_TIMESTAMP(dateColumn) as time_sec_                                                  |
| `$__timeEpoch(dateColumn)`                            | Will be replaced by an expression to convert to a UNIX timestamp and rename the column to `time_sec`. For example, _UNIX_TIMESTAMP(dateColumn) as time_sec_                                                  |
| `$__timeFilter(dateColumn)`                           | Will be replaced by a time range filter using the specified column name. For example, _dateColumn BETWEEN FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410783) AND FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410983)_                                           |
| `$__timeFrom()`                                       | Will be replaced by the start of the currently active time selection. For example, _FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410783)_                                                                                               |
| `$__timeTo()`                                         | Will be replaced by the end of the currently active time selection. For example, _FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410983)_                                                                                                 |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m')`                       | Will be replaced by an expression usable in GROUP BY clause. For example, *cast(cast(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(dateColumn)/(300) as signed)*300 as signed),\*                                                           |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', 0)`                    | Same as above but with a fill parameter so missing points in that series will be added by grafana and 0 will be used as value (only works with time series queries).                                         |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', NULL)`                 | Same as above but NULL will be used as value for missing points (only works with time series queries).                                                                                                       |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', previous)`             | Same as above but the previous value in that series will be used as fill value if no value has been seen yet NULL will be used (only works with time series queries).                                        |
| `$__timeGroupAlias(dateColumn,'5m')`                  | Will be replaced identical to $\_\_timeGroup but with an added column alias.                                                                                                                                 |
| `$__unixEpochFilter(dateColumn)`                      | Will be replaced by a time range filter using the specified column name with times represented as Unix timestamp. For example, _dateColumn > 1494410783 AND dateColumn < 1494497183_                         |
| `$__unixEpochFrom()`                                  | Will be replaced by the start of the currently active time selection as Unix timestamp. For example, _1494410783_                                                                                            |
| `$__unixEpochTo()`                                    | Will be replaced by the end of the currently active time selection as Unix timestamp. For example, _1494497183_                                                                                              |
| `$__unixEpochNanoFilter(dateColumn)`                  | Will be replaced by a time range filter using the specified column name with times represented as nanosecond timestamp. For example, _dateColumn > 1494410783152415214 AND dateColumn < 1494497183142514872_ |
| `$__unixEpochNanoFrom()`                              | Will be replaced by the start of the currently active time selection as nanosecond timestamp. For example, _1494410783152415214_                                                                             |
| `$__unixEpochNanoTo()`                                | Will be replaced by the end of the currently active time selection as nanosecond timestamp. For example, _1494497183142514872_                                                                               |
| `$__unixEpochGroup(dateColumn,'5m', [fillmode])`      | Same as $\_\_timeGroup but for times stored as Unix timestamp (`fillMode` only works with time series queries).                                                                                              |
| `$__unixEpochGroupAlias(dateColumn,'5m', [fillmode])` | Same as above but also adds a column alias (`fillMode` only works with time series queries).                                                                                                                 |

## Table queries

If the `Format as` query option is set to `Table` then you can basically do any type of SQL query. The table panel will automatically show the results of whatever columns and rows your query returns.

Query editor with example query:

{{< figure src="/static/img/docs/v45/mysql_table_query.png" >}}

The query:

```sql
SELECT
  title as 'Title',
  user.login as 'Created By' ,
  dashboard.created as 'Created On'
 FROM dashboard
INNER JOIN user on user.id = dashboard.created_by
WHERE $__timeFilter(dashboard.created)
```

You can control the name of the Table panel columns by using regular `as ` SQL column selection syntax.

The resulting table panel:

![](/static/img/docs/v43/mysql_table.png)

## Time series queries

The examples in this section query the following table:

```text
+---------------------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| time_date_time      | value_double | CreatedAt           | hostname |
+---------------------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 3.0          | 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 10.0.1.1 |
| 2020-01-02 03:06:00 | 4.0          | 2020-01-02 03:06:00 | 10.0.1.2 |
| 2020-01-02 03:10:00 | 6.0          | 2020-01-02 03:10:00 | 10.0.1.1 |
| 2020-01-02 03:11:00 | 7.0          | 2020-01-02 03:11:00 | 10.0.1.2 |
| 2020-01-02 03:20:00 | 5.0          | 2020-01-02 03:20:00 | 10.0.1.2 |
+---------------------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
```

If the `Format as` query option is set to `Time Series` then the query must have a column named time that returns either a SQL datetime or any numeric datatype representing Unix epoch in seconds. In addition, result sets of time series queries must be sorted by time for panels to properly visualize the result.

A time series query result is returned in a [wide data frame format](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/key-concepts/data-frames#wide-format). Any column except time or of type string transforms into value fields in the data frame query result. Any string column transforms into field labels in the data frame query result.

> For backward compatibility, there's an exception to the above rule for queries that return three columns including a string column named metric. Instead of transforming the metric column into field labels, it becomes the field name, and then the series name is formatted as the value of the metric column. See the example with the metric column below.

To optionally customize the default series name formatting, refer to [Standard options definitions](ref:configure-standard-options-display-name).

**Example with `metric` column:**

```sql
SELECT
  $__timeGroupAlias(time_date_time,'5m'),
  min(value_double),
  'min' as metric
FROM test_data
WHERE $__timeFilter(time_date_time)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

Data frame result:

```text
+---------------------+-----------------+
| Name: time          | Name: min       |
| Labels:             | Labels:         |
| Type: []time.Time   | Type: []float64 |
+---------------------+-----------------+
| 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 3               |
| 2020-01-02 03:10:00 | 6               |
| 2020-01-02 03:20:00 | 5               |
+---------------------+-----------------+
```

**Example using the fill parameter in the $\_\_timeGroupAlias macro to convert null values to be zero instead:**

```sql
SELECT
  $__timeGroupAlias(createdAt,'5m',0),
  sum(value_double) as value,
  hostname
FROM test_data
WHERE
  $__timeFilter(createdAt)
GROUP BY time, hostname
ORDER BY time
```

Given the data frame result in the following example and using the graph panel, you will get two series named _value 10.0.1.1_ and _value 10.0.1.2_. To render the series with a name of _10.0.1.1_ and _10.0.1.2_ , use a [Standard options definitions](ref:configure-standard-options-display-name) display value of `${__field.labels.hostname}`.

Data frame result:

```text
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Name: time          | Name: value               | Name: value               |
| Labels:             | Labels: hostname=10.0.1.1 | Labels: hostname=10.0.1.2 |
| Type: []time.Time   | Type: []float64           | Type: []float64           |
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+

```

**Example with multiple columns:**

```sql
SELECT
  $__timeGroupAlias(time_date_time,'5m'),
  min(value_double) as min_value,
  max(value_double) as max_value
FROM test_data
WHERE $__timeFilter(time_date_time)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

Data frame result:

```text
+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Name: time          | Name: min_value | Name: max_value |
| Labels:             | Labels:         | Labels:         |
| Type: []time.Time   | Type: []float64 | Type: []float64 |

```

Currently, there is no support for a dynamic group by time based on time range and panel width.
This is something we plan to add.

## Templating

This feature is currently available in the nightly builds and will be included in the 5.0.0 release.

Instead of hard-coding things like server, application and sensor name in your metric queries you can use variables in their place. Variables are shown as dropdown select boxes at the top of the dashboard. These dropdowns make it easy to change the data being displayed in your dashboard.

Check out the [Templating](ref:variables) documentation for an introduction to the templating feature and the different types of template variables.

### Query Variable

If you add a template variable of the type `Query`, you can write a MySQL query that can
return things like measurement names, key names or key values that are shown as a dropdown select box.

For example, you can have a variable that contains all values for the `hostname` column in a table if you specify a query like this in the templating variable _Query_ setting.

```sql
SELECT hostname FROM my_host
```

A query can return multiple columns and Grafana will automatically create a list from them. For example, the query below will return a list with values from `hostname` and `hostname2`.

```sql
SELECT my_host.hostname, my_other_host.hostname2 FROM my_host JOIN my_other_host ON my_host.city = my_other_host.city
```

To use time range dependent macros like `$__timeFilter(column)` in your query the refresh mode of the template variable needs to be set to _On Time Range Change_.

```sql
SELECT event_name FROM event_log WHERE $__timeFilter(time_column)
```

Another option is a query that can create a key/value variable. The query should return two columns that are named `__text` and `__value`. The `__text` column value should be unique (if it is not unique then the first value is used). The options in the dropdown will have a text and value that allows you to have a friendly name as text and an id as the value. An example query with `hostname` as the text and `id` as the value:

```sql
SELECT hostname AS __text, id AS __value FROM my_host
```

You can also create nested variables. For example if you had another variable named `region`. Then you could have
the hosts variable only show hosts from the current selected region with a query like this (if `region` is a multi-value variable then use the `IN` comparison operator rather than `=` to match against multiple values):

```sql
SELECT hostname FROM my_host  WHERE region IN($region)
```

#### Using `__searchFilter` to filter results in Query Variable

Using `__searchFilter` in the query field will filter the query result based on what the user types in the dropdown select box.
When nothing has been entered by the user the default value for `__searchFilter` is `%`.

> Important that you surround the `__searchFilter` expression with quotes as Grafana does not do this for you.

The example below shows how to use `__searchFilter` as part of the query field to enable searching for `hostname` while the user types in the dropdown select box.

Query

```sql
SELECT hostname FROM my_host  WHERE hostname LIKE '$__searchFilter'
```

### Using Variables in Queries

Template variable values are only quoted when the template variable is a `multi-value`.

If the variable is a multi-value variable then use the `IN` comparison operator rather than `=` to match against multiple values.

There are two syntaxes:

`$<varname>` Example with a template variable named `hostname`:

```sql
SELECT
  UNIX_TIMESTAMP(atimestamp) as time,
  aint as value,
  avarchar as metric
FROM my_table
WHERE $__timeFilter(atimestamp) and hostname in($hostname)
ORDER BY atimestamp ASC
```

`[[varname]]` Example with a template variable named `hostname`:

```sql
SELECT
  UNIX_TIMESTAMP(atimestamp) as time,
  aint as value,
  avarchar as metric
FROM my_table
WHERE $__timeFilter(atimestamp) and hostname in([[hostname]])
ORDER BY atimestamp ASC
```

#### Disabling Quoting for Multi-value Variables

Grafana automatically creates a quoted, comma-separated string for multi-value variables. For example: if `server01` and `server02` are selected then it will be formatted as: `'server01', 'server02'`. To disable quoting, use the csv formatting option for variables:

`${servers:csv}`

Read more about variable formatting options in the [Variables](ref:variable-syntax-advanced-variable-format-options) documentation.

## Annotations

[Annotations](ref:annotate-visualizations) allow you to overlay rich event information on top of graphs. You add annotation queries via the Dashboard menu / Annotations view.

**Example query using time column with epoch values:**

```sql
SELECT
  epoch_time as time,
  metric1 as text,
  CONCAT(tag1, ',', tag2) as tags
FROM
  public.test_data
WHERE
  $__unixEpochFilter(epoch_time)
```

**Example region query using time and timeend columns with epoch values:**

```sql
SELECT
  epoch_time as time,
  epoch_timeend as timeend,
  metric1 as text,
  CONCAT(tag1, ',', tag2) as tags
FROM
  public.test_data
WHERE
  $__unixEpochFilter(epoch_time)
```

**Example query using time column of native SQL date/time data type:**

```sql
SELECT
  native_date_time as time,
  metric1 as text,
  CONCAT(tag1, ',', tag2) as tags
FROM
  public.test_data
WHERE
  $__timeFilter(native_date_time)
```

| Name      | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time`    | The name of the date/time field. Could be a column with a native SQL date/time data type or epoch value.          |
| `timeend` | Optional name of the end date/time field. Could be a column with a native SQL date/time data type or epoch value. |
| `text`    | Event description field.                                                                                          |
| `tags`    | Optional field name to use for event tags as a comma separated string.                                            |

## Alerting

Time series queries should work in alerting conditions. Table formatted queries are not yet supported in alert rule conditions.
