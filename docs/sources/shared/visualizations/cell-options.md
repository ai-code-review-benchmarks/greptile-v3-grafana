**Cell value inspect** enables value inspection from table cells.
When the switch is toggled on, clicking the inspect icon in a cell opens the **Inspect value** drawer which contains two tabs: **Plain text** and **Code editor**.

Grafana attempts to automatically detect the type of data in the cell and opens the drawer with the associated tab showing.
However, you can switch back and forth between tabs.
