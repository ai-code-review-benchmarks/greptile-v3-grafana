# Multiple y-axes

In some cases, you might want to display multiple y-axes. For example, if you have a dataset showing both temperature and humidity over time, you might want to show two y-axes with different units for these two series.

You can configure multiple y-axes and control where they're displayed in the visualization by adding field overrides. [This example of a dataset that includes temperature and humidity](../../configure-overrides/#example-2-format-temperature-and-humidity) describes how you could configure that. Follow the steps as many times as required to add as many y-axes as you need.
