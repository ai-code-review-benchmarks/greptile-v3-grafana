title: Data links and actions options
comments: |
  There are five data link shared files, datalink-options.md, datalink-options-1.md, datalink-options-2.md, datalink-options-3.md, datalink-options-4.md to cover the most common combinations of options. 
  Using shared files ensures that content remains consistent across visualizations that share the same options and users don't have to figure out which options apply to a specific visualization when reading that content.
  This file is used in the table visualization for the Data links and Pill cell types.

Toggle the **Wrap text** switch to wrap text in the cell that contains the longest content in your table.
To wrap the text _in a specific column only_, use a **Fields with name** [field override](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/configure-overrides/), select the **Cell options > Cell type** override property, and toggle on the **Wrap text** switch.
Text wrapping is in [public preview](https://grafana.com/docs/release-life-cycle/#public-preview), however, itâ€™s available to use by default.
