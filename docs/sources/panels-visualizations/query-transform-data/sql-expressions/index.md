# SQL expressions

{{< docs/private-preview product="SQL expressions" >}}

SQL Expressions are server-side expressions that manipulate and transform the results of data source queries using MySQL-like syntax. They allow you to easily query and transform your data after it has been queried, using SQL, which provides a familiar and powerful syntax that can handle everything from simple filters to highly complex, multi-step transformations.

In Grafana, a server-side expression is a way to transform or calculate data after it has been retrieved from the data source, but before it is sent to the frontend for visualization. Grafana evaluates these expressions on the server, not in the browser or at the data source.

For general information on Grafana expressions, refer to [Write expression queries](ref:expressions).

## Before you begin

- Enable SQL expressions under the feature toggle `sqlExpressions`.  

  - If you self-host Grafana, you can find feature toggles in the configuration file `grafana.ini`.

```
[feature_toggles]
enable = sqlExpresssions
```

- If you are using Grafana Cloud, contact [Support](https://grafana.com/help/) to enable this feature.

## Transform data with SQL expressions

SQL expressions allow you to:

- Shape, transform, and modify query results without affecting the original query.
- `JOIN` data in tables
- Create alerts or recording rules on the transformed data
- Ability to do final-stage modifications to datasets, including:
  - Show, hide, and rename columns.
  - Filter data - select only certain rows based on conditions.
  - Aggregate data - perform calculations across groups of data (e.g., sum, average, count).
- Write subqueries and CTEs
- Subqueries are nested queries within a larger query,  which is useful for filtering, calculations, or transformations.
- CTEs, or Common Table Expressions, are temporary named result sets that make complex queries more readable and reusable.

A key capability of SQL expressions is the ability to JOIN data. Users want to combine and transform data from multiple tables in a way that is predictable, user-friendly, and capable of supporting even highly complex operations as needed. You can JOIN data from an unlimited number of data source queries.

To work with SQL expressions, you must use data from a backend data source. In Grafana, a backend data source refers to a data source plugin or integration that communicates with a database, service, or API through the Grafana server, rather than directly from the browser (frontend).

## Compatible data sources

The following are compatible data sources:

Full support:

- Elasticsearch
- MySQL
- Loki
- Graphite
- Google Sheets
- Amazon Athena

Partial support: The following data sources offer limited or conditional support. Some allow different types of queries depending on the service being accessed. For example, Azure Monitor can query multiple services, each with its own query format. In some cases, you can also change the query type within a panel. Supported data formats include: `JSON`, `CSV`, and `TSV`.

- InfluxDB
- Infinity
- Azure Monitor
- TestData
- Tempo
- Prometheus
- Cloudwatch
- GitHub
- BigQuery

## Create SQL expressions

To create a SQL expression, complete the following steps:

1. Enable SQL expression under the feature toggle sqlExpressions.  
1. Once enabled, navigate to Dashboards in the left-side menu. 
1. Open a dashboard panel.
1. Click Transform, then Add Expression and select SQL.

Once you have added a SQL expression, you can select from other Data source queries by referencing the RefIDs of the queries in your SQL expression as if they were tables in a SQL database.

![Using the RefID](/media/docs/sql-expressions/using-the-RefID.png)

## Workflow to build SQL expressions

1. **Build your base queries.** Create the individual query and give it a meaningful name. Create the queries (A, B, etc.) that provide the data you want to combine or transform using SQL Expressions.  
1. **Hide your base queries.** Click the üëÅÔ∏è Eye icon next to each base query to hide them from visualization. This keeps your panel clean while still making the data available to the SQL Expression.  
1. **Switch to table view**. Set the panel visualization to **Table** to inspect and review the structure and output of your SQL expression as you build and refine it.  
1. **Add a SQL Expression**. Add a new query and add select SQL Expression as its type.   
   **Inspect inputs**. Start with simple test queries to understand the shape of your input frames.   

   ```sql
   SELECT \* FROM A LIMIT 10\. 
   ```

   This lets you see the available columns and sample rows from query A. Repeat this for each input query you want to use (e.g., SELECT \* FROM B LIMIT 10).  
1. **Inspect your data**. Repeat this for each input query to understand the column structure and data types you're working with.

    ```sql
    SELECT \* FROM \<B, C, D, etc\> LIMIT 10
    ```

1. **Construct the SQL expression.** Once you understand your data, you can write your SQL expression to join, filter, or otherwise transform the data.  
1. **Validate and iterate**. Click **Refresh** every time you update your SQL query to re-evaluate and see the updated result.

When selecting a visualization type, **ensure your SQL expression returns data in the required shape**. For example, time series panels require a column with a time field (e.g., timestamp) and a numeric value column (e.g., \_\_value\_\_). If the output is not shaped correctly, your visualization may appear empty or fail to render.

The workflow is designed this way to :

- If an input query is not hidden, Grafana will attempt to visualize it in addition to the SQL expression. This can clutter the output, especially in table view.  
- The results of your SQL expression might not be immediately visible unless you switch to the correct data frame using the dropdown at the bottom of the table view.  
- In non-table visualizations, data that doesn't match the expected structure may not render at all.

For data to be used in SQL expressions, it must be in a **tabular format**, specifically the **FullLong format**. This means all relevant data is contained within a single table, with values such as metric labels stored as columns and individual cells. Because not all data sources return results in this format by default, Grafana will automatically convert compatible query results to FullLong format when they are referenced in a SQL expression.  

## SQL conversion rules

When a RefID is referenced within a SQL statement (e.g., SELECT * FROM A), the system invokes a distinct SQL conversion process.

The SQL conversion path:

- The query result is treated as a single data frame, without labels, and is mapped directly to a tabular format.
- If the frame type is present and is either numeric, wide time series, or multi-frame time series (for example, labeled formats), Grafana automatically converts the data into a table structure.

## Known limitations

- Currently, only one SQL expression is supported per panel or alert.
- Grafana supports certain data sources. Refer to[compatible data sources](#compatible-data-sources).

## Supported data source formats

Grafana supports three types of data source response formats:

1. **Single Table-like Frame**: This refers to data returned in a standard tabular structure, where all values are organized into rows and columns, similar to what you'd get from a SQL query.  
    - **Example**: Any query against a SQL data source (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with the format set to Table.

2. **Dataplane: Time Series Format**: This format represents time series data with timestamps and associated values. It is typically returned from monitoring data sources.  
    - **Example**: Prometheus or Loki Range Queries (queries that return a set of values over time).

3. **Dataplane: Numeric Long Format**: This format is used for point-in-time (instant) metric queries that return a single value (or a set of values) at a specific moment.  
    - **Example**: Prometheus or Loki Instant Queries (queries that return the current value of a metric).

For more information on Dataplane formats, refer to [Grafana Dataplane Documentation](https://grafana.com/developers/dataplane).

How are Dataplane Time Series and Numeric Kinds that are not in tabular format converted?
Both Dataplane Time Series and Numeric Long formats are not tabular by default, but Grafana automatically converts them into a tabular format (FullLong) when they are used in a SQL expression.

Label data (e.g., metric labels) is converted into nullable string columns:
Label keys become column names
Label values become the values in each row (or null if a label is missing)

The `value` column contains the numeric metric value. If a display name exists, it will appear in the  `display_name` column. Metric names are added in the `metric_name` column. For time series data, there will be a time column containing the timestamp.

## Troubleshooting and best practices

**Scenario**:  My SQL expression result looks like a time series. How do I graph it using the Time series panel?

Use the **Prepare time series** transformation:

1. Add a transformation.  
2. Choose **Prepare time series**  
3. Select **Format to Multi-frame time series**

## SQL Expressions examples

Add 2 or 3 examples of creating SQL expressions

Possible example \- Example using PromQL ([Kyle‚Äôs doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOjCn9AANP6qmzlUAQj5CNh7wgHsWHEEaKTanG_TPgw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3ooblta28mwr))  
 

1. Create the following Prometheus query:

   Add the PromQL query

2. Add a SQL expression: Once you add a SQL expression that selects from RefID A it gets converted to a table response 

   SELECT \* from A:
